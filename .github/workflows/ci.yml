# Notes:
# - This workflow builds and tests on every push to `main` and on pull requests.
# - When you push a tag matching `v*` (for example `v1.0.0`), the `release` job
#   will run and create a GitHub release with the compiled binary attached.
# - If you'd like a release on every push to `main` instead, change the `if:` condition
#   on the `release` job (but creating releases from ordinary commits is less common).
# - For multi-platform releases (Windows/macOS), add separate matrix jobs or use cross-compilation steps.
